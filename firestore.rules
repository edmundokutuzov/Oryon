/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and shared access based on membership lists for projects and meetings. Public read access is granted to chat messages.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public user profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Stores project details with a list of member user IDs.
 * - /projects/{projectId}/tasks/{taskId}: Stores tasks associated with a specific project. Access is controlled by project membership.
 * - /meetings/{meetingId}: Stores meeting details with a list of participant user IDs.
 * - /chat/{channelId}/messages/{messageId}: Stores chat messages, publicly readable.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - Users can only read/write their own profile data.
 * - Project data access is restricted to project members.
 * - Task data access is restricted to project members.
 * - Meeting data access is restricted to meeting participants.
 * - Chat messages are publicly readable, but write access is not allowed.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed for privacy.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 * - Projects and Meetings store user IDs directly in the 'members' and 'participants' fields respectively, enabling direct access checks without additional database reads.
 *
 * @structuralSegregation
 * - Drafts and published content are not explicitly supported, but the structure allows for adding a status field to projects and tasks to differentiate between public and private states if required.
