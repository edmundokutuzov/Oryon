/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Oryon Enterprise platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data,
 * combined with role-based access for sensitive data like security logs.
 * Public read access is not granted to any collections in this initial configuration.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`, ensuring only the authenticated user
 *   can access their own profile.
 * - Tasks, Comments, and Calendar Events are nested under `/users/{userId}`, maintaining
 *   a clear ownership hierarchy.
 * - Departments are stored under `/departments/{departmentId}` and are secured based on
 *   potential role-based access (currently restricted).
 * - Security logs are stored under `/securityLogs/{securityLogId}` and are only accessible
 *   to authorized roles (currently restricted).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent unauthorized enumeration of user accounts.
 * - Public read access is disabled for all collections to ensure data privacy.
 * - Data validation is minimized in this prototyping phase to allow for flexible schema iteration.
 * - The default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To simplify and optimize security rules, ownership is enforced through path-based
 * matching (e.g., `/users/{userId}`) and denormalized fields in subcollections, such as
 * embedding the `userId` within Task documents. This approach avoids costly `get()`
 * operations in security rules.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * User-specific private data is stored in user subcollections, providing a clear
 * separation between public and private data.
